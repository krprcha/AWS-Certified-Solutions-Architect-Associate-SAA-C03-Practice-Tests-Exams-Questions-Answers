- Add a WAF tier by creating a new ELB and an AutoScaling group of EC2 Instances running a host based WAF They would redirect Route 53 to resolve to the new WAF tier ELB The WAF tier wouldthier pass the traffic to the current web tier The web tier Security Groups would be updated to only allow traffic from the WAF tier Security Group
- Remove all but TLS 1 2 from the web tier ELB and enable Advanced Protocol Filtering This will enable the ELB itself to perform WAF functionality

138. You have been given a scope to set up an AWS Media Sharing Framework for a new start up photo sharing company similar to flickr.

139. You need a persistent and durable storage to trace call activity of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. Call duration is mostly in the 2-3 minutes timeframe. Each traced call can be either active or terminated. An external application needs to know each minute the list of currently active calls, which are usually a few calls/second. Put once per month there is a periodic peak up to 1000 calls/second for a few hours. The system is open 24/7 and any downtime should be avoided. Historical data is periodically archived to files. Cost saving is a priority for this project. What database implementation would better fit this scenario, keeping costs as low as possible?
- Use RDS Multi-AZ with two tables, one for 'Active calls' and one for 'Terminated calls'. in this way the 'Active calls' table is always small and effective to access
- Use DynamoDB with a 'Calls' table and a Global Secondary Index on a 'lsActive' attribute that is present for active calls only in this way the Global Secondary index is sparse and more effective
- Use DynamoDB with a 'Calls' table and a Global secondary index on a 'State' attribute that can equal to 'active' or 'terminated' in this way the Global Secondary index can be used for all Items in the table
- Use RDS Multi-AZ with a 'CALLS' table and an Indexed 'STATE* field that can be equal to 'ACTIVE' or 'TERMINATED' in this way the SOL query Is optimized by the use of the Index
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
140. If you have chosen Multi-AZ deployment, in the event of a planned or unplanned outage of your primary DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to the standby replica. The automatic failover mechanism simply changes the record of the main DB Instance to point to the standby DB Instance.

204. You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached. The EC2 instance is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS. The four EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID 0 device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4,000IOPS (4,000 16KB reads or writes), for a total of 16,000 random IOPS on the instance. The EC2 instance initially delivers the expected 16,000 IOPS random read and write performance. Sometime later, in order to increase the total random I/O performance of the instance, you add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes to the RAID. Each volume is provisioned to 4,000 IOPs like the original four, for a total of 24,000 IOPS on the EC2 instance. Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%, but the total random IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all. What is the problem and a valid solution?
- Larger storage volumes support higher Provisioned IOPS rates; increase the provisioned volume storage of each of the 6 EBS volumes to 1TB
- The EBS-Optimized throughput limits the total IOPS that can be utilized; use an EBS Optimized instance that provides larger throughput. Mo
- Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I/O throughput; configure the instance device driver and filesystem to use 64KB blocks to increase throughput
- The standard EBS Instance root volume limits the total IOPS rate; change the instance root volume to also be a 500GB 4,000 Provisioned IOPS volume
- RAID 0 only scales linearly to about 4 devices; use RAID 0 with 4 EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes, but increase each Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to 6,000 IOPS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
205. A user has configured a website and launched it using the Apache web server on port 80. The user is using ELB with the EC2 instances for Load Balancing. What should the user do to ensure that the EC2 instances accept requests only from ELB?

- Configure the EC2 instance so that it only listens on the ELB port

391. You have recently joined a startup company building sensors to measure street noise and air quality in urban areas. The company has been running a pilot deployment of around 100 sensors for 3 months each sensor uploads 1KB of sensor data every minute to a backend hosted on AWS. During the pilot, you measured a peak or 10 IOPS on the database, and you stored an average of 3GB of sensor data per month in the database. The current deployment consists of a load-balanced auto scaled Ingestion layer using EC2 instances and a PostgreSQL RDS database with 500GB standard storage. The pilot is considered a success and your CEO has managed to get the attention or some potential investors. The business plan requires a deployment of at least lOOK sensors which needs to be supported by the backend. You also need to store sensor data for at least two years to be able to compare year over year Improvements. To secure funding, you have to make sure that the platform meets these requirements and leaves room for further scaling. Which setup win meet the requirements?
- Add an SQS queue to the ingestion layer to buffer writes to the RDS instance
- Ingest data into a DynamoDB table and move old data to a Redshift cluster
- Replace the RDS instance with a 6 node Redshift cluster with 96TB of storage
- Keep the current architecture but upgrade RDS storage to 3TB and lOK provisioned IOPS
